# SpreadSheetExample

How to install:
To assemble the project you need to install Node.js of version 6 oh higher;

1. Download or pull project source to the *directory*.
2. Go to *directory* and run *npm install* from terminal in unix based system or node.js cli interface in windows.
3. After all dependencies would be loaded, run *mpn start* to assemble the project and start webpack development server.
4. After successfull build go to the browser and enter *http://localhost:8080* to view the application.

How it was done:
The application uses Webpack as a module bundler for TypeScript modules. Angular.io as a visualize framework. And Grape City SpreadSheet as a main component.
This example is heavelly based on [InspectorSample](http://spread.grapecity.com/Demos/JS/InspectorSample/) example.
